# Simple JavaScript App (Pokédex)

This is Pokédex Web App that displays Pokémon details using an API (App Programing Interface).

A web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and Bootstrap that loads data from an external API ('https://pokeapi.co/'). This app displays a Modal window upon clicking on a pokemon's name enabling the user to find out more detail information about the Pokémons such as their height and type.  Moreover, an image of the pokémon is also displayed.

# Project Description
